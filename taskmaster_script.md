 taskmaster workflow to automate the process

 Project requirement generation starts first
 – First, we need to create the idea and make it so that it generates code that we want to execute
 – Ensure uses code standards, such as consistent abstraction levels for functions, slam, and other simple code standards, singletons for web
 – Make sure it uses the tools that we want like vite for building libraries, gsap, for animations, TSX react, Singleton's, And Zeus stand for state management
 – Insurance starts with the first task of creating the read me and bases the project requirements off of the read me
 – Ensure the task order is logical by create the read me create the higher level folder structure for the project, create the wire frame of the project, and then confirm this before proceeding adding a human in loop section
 – Make sure that it always adds errors and solutions to the errors it found to the rule section so that it can learn
 –make sure it gives a output from a high-level first, and then goes in deeper, make sure the task breakdown is simple and discussed with you first 

 Make it actually add to a different task tracking Reed me to give the current questions and considerations that it has
