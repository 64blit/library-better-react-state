# Motivation

## Why Another State Management Library?

The React ecosystem has several excellent state management libraries (Redux, MobX, Recoil, Jotai, Zustand), each with its own strengths. Better React State was created to specifically address these challenges:

1. **Organizational Complexity**: As applications grow, organizing state and its related functionality becomes increasingly difficult.
2. **Business Logic Mix**: Tangling business logic with UI components creates maintainability issues.
3. **Architectural Rigidity**: Most state solutions don't embrace clean architecture principles.
4. **Developer Experience**: State management often requires verbose boilerplate code.
5. **Performance Considerations**: Optimizing re-renders and bundle size requires careful consideration.

## Core Principles

Better React State is built on these guiding principles:

### 1. Feature-Oriented Architecture

State should be organized around business features rather than technical concerns. Each feature should have its own slice of state, actions, and business logic, promoting:

- **Maintainability**: Each feature is modular and self-contained
- **Discoverability**: Developers can easily find relevant code
- **Testability**: Features can be tested in isolation

### 2. Clean Architecture

The library embraces clean architecture patterns:

- **Domain Entities**: Core business objects with validation rules
- **Use Cases**: Business logic separated from state and UI via controllers
- **Error Handling**: Structured error management with domain-specific errors
- **Event System**: Domain events for cross-cutting concerns

### 3. Developer Experience

Developer experience is paramount:

- **Minimal Boilerplate**: Concise API without ceremony
- **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript support with inference
- **Familiar Patterns**: Builds on well-established approaches
- **Debugging Tools**: Time-travel debugging, state snapshots, performance monitoring

### 4. Performance First

Performance is a foundational concern:

- **Minimal Re-renders**: Fine-grained reactivity and selector optimization
- **Bundle Size**: Tree-shakable architecture with dynamic imports
- **Split Configuration**: Features like persistence are code-split and loaded on demand

## Built on Zustand

Better React State is built on [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), a proven minimalistic state management library. We chose Zustand for these reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: Zustand's core API is remarkably simple yet powerful
2. **Hooks-Based**: First-class support for React hooks
3. **Middleware**: Extensible middleware system
4. **Performance**: Excellent update performance with minimal re-renders
5. **Community**: Strong community support and active development

Better React State extends Zustand with feature-oriented architecture, clean architecture patterns, and enhanced development tools.

## Comparison with Other Libraries

### vs Redux + Redux Toolkit

Redux is powerful but often requires significant boilerplate even with Redux Toolkit. Better React State offers:

- More concise feature definitions
- Built-in controller pattern for complex business logic
- Simpler async handling without thunks or sagas
- Reduced bundle size and simpler learning curve

### vs MobX

MobX uses observable-based reactivity, which differs from Better React State's approach:

- No decorators or reactive primitives required
- Explicit state updates via actions
- Better TypeScript integration out of the box
- Simpler mental model for React developers

### vs Recoil/Jotai

Atom-based libraries like Recoil and Jotai shine for decentralized state, while Better React State excels at:

- Organizing state around business features
- Managing complex relational state
- Supporting clean architecture patterns
- Providing persistence and synchronization

## Use Cases

Better React State is particularly well-suited for:

- **Medium to Large Applications**: Where organized state management becomes critical
- **Domain-Rich Applications**: With complex business rules and validations
- **Team Environments**: Where code organization and maintainability are priorities
- **Enterprise Applications**: Requiring clean architecture and separation of concerns

## Inspiration

This library draws inspiration from:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: For its focus on the business domain
- **Clean Architecture**: For separation of concerns
- **Redux Toolkit**: For its developer experience improvements
- **Zustand**: For its simplicity and performance
- **Feature-Sliced Design**: For feature-oriented code organization
